# Description

SmartTour is a service provided through mobile app / web that allows tourists in a city to consult about the points of attraction they want to visit, obtain information about them and earn points for visiting them which is redeemable for vouchers provided by partnerships (restaurants, museums, parks, theaters, hotels, etc).

In addition, the service makes it possible to determine if the point of interest is subject to high tourist pressure (lot of people) or not. Moreover the service recommends other potential points of interest or even possible itineraries. The lower the level of tourist pressure in a point of interest or itinerary, the more points it will give.

Both in the case of a point of interest or a itinerary there is always the possibility of saving them to visit later.The point of interests in each itinerary are relatively close to each other and, in this way, the user can better manage his time without traveling long distances. 

By completing an itinerary bonus points are obtained as a way of promoting a more friendly tourism with the city. In all cases, to obtain points, can QR codes physically located in each place searched or recommended is needed when they are visited.
